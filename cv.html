               Project: <br>Tom Grennan VR<br>
               My main role on Tom Grennan VR was creating a full 3D environment based on a LIDAR data and
               photogrammetry of the world famous Metropolis Studios.
               As the only artist on the team, this was a great challenge and really pushed every part of my skill set.
               Working from the point cloud data, I modelled, textured and, lit the environment, built vfx, and created
               shaders for our specific requirements.

               Project: <br>Fable The Journey<br>
               Facial animation at Lionhead was created with a morph-target based system. This was primarily used to
               create animations using video reverence from mo-cap shoots, but also animating to a audio track without
               video reference.

                  Project: KINECT SPORTS Season Two<br>
                  Over the development of the Bafta winning Kinect Sports Season Two I took on many roles.
                  Primarily creating in-game assets such as sports equipment, I also spent time rigging props for
                  animation, and tracking down and solving bugs found by the QA team.
                  I was kept on for the development of the DLC, and am very proud that some of the new game modes rely
                  entirely on art that I created.
